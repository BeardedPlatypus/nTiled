State
=====

The `State` module holds all classes and structs related to the state of
a single run of `nTiled`.

The state itself does not contain any functions and merely serves as a
datastructure on which each component of `nTiled` act.

It has been separeted in several sections in order to decrease coupling
within `nTiled`.
