`nTiled` Documentation
======================

`nTiled` is an `openGL` viewer that implements tiled and clustered shading as
well as a novel technique named hierarchical shading. It is written to evaulate
the time and space complexity of said algorithms.

`nTiled` is written as part of my thesis in order to obtain my masters in
computer science at KU Leuven.
